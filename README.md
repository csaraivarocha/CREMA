By time, the owners of the device will have the local weather history and will contribute to city and country weather monitoring, by contributing with their local information to the world wide. 

There wil also be B2B intagration, by sharing local weather information with Wase App, for exemple, or just consulting other local weathers on CREMA home page. So it can know how the weather is in another place in the city exactly, instead of obtaining information from central climate stations that provide inaccurate locally weather data.
